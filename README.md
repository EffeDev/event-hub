# Events For Front End (Effe)

Effe (pr. e-ff-y) connects your frontend javascript applications to your backend Event Driven Architecture (EDA).
Effe is a framework-agnostic event hub providing a familiar event bus interface for your front-end components combined 
with an extensible connector interface to enable events to flow between your backend hosted server components.
